# Admin in a day

# Module 2: Reporting and Telemetry

# Hands on lab

# Lab Scenario

In this Hands-on Lab, you are an administrator for Contoso helping adopt the Power Platform.

An important part of keeping the Power Platform running successfully is monitoring the ongoing usage. In this hands-on lab you will be using the platform tools and the CoE Starter Kit to perform usage monitoring.

# Lab Requirements

## Lab Test Environment

This hands-on lab is designed to be completed in an environment setup for multiple students to complete the Admin in a day series of hands on labs.

You need to use the assigned user and environment information to complete this lab. You must have completed the prior labs to successfully complete this lab.

# Exercise 1: Explore the CoE Starter Kit

## Scenario

In this exercise, you will explore some of the apps and analytics that are part of the Power Platform CoE Starter Kit.  We have already installed and configured the starter kit into the tenant you are using for this lab.  As part of configuring we imported the solution, shared the apps, configured the flows that synchronize data and published the Power BI report.  If you were doing this in your own tenant, you would follow the instructions to complete these steps.

Now in this exercise, you will explore the following key components

-	Power Platform Admin View app
-	Power BI Dashboard
-	The business process that is used by the Developer Compliance process

### Task 1: Explore the Power Platform Admin View app

8.	In the **Audit** tab you can see the Business Justification provided by the app maker using the Developer Compliance Center app.  In the bottom part is where you as an admin can provide your risk assessment.  You can also tag the app to show in the App Catalog and make it featured.  You can customize the CoE entities to add additional fields here if needed.
